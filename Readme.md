> Advanced healthcare insights powered by AI - analyze food, track health metrics, get personalized recommendations

[Live Demo](https://intel-medi-link.vercel.app)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Deployed Version (Recommended)

The application is fully deployed and ready to use:

- **Frontend**: Available at [https://intel-medi-link.vercel.app](https://intel-medi-link.vercel.app)
- **Node.js Backend**: Already running on Render
- **Python ML Backend**: Running on Kaggle

Simply visit the [live demo](https://intel-medi-link.vercel.app) to use the application without any setup!

### Option 2: Run Frontend Locally (with deployed backends)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jaisanth123/Intel_MediLink.git

# Navigate to frontend directory
cd Intel_MediLink/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### ML Backend (Python with FastAPI) - Kaggle Only

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The Python backend must be run on Kaggle for optimal performance, not locally.

To access or run the Python ML backend:

1. Visit the [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jaisanthk/intel-project-hospital)
2. Set up your Hugging Face token in Kaggle secrets as "hf_token"

#### Python Backend (Kaggle)

Set up the Hugging Face token in your Kaggle secrets:

- Secret name: `hf_token`
- Secret value: Your Hugging Face API token

> **Important**: While logging in, use the following Hugging Face token as a secret:
>
> `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`
>
> This token has been provided for review purposes. After the review by the intel team, I will remove it.

---

3. If you want to run the notebook cells

```python
# ONLY RUN THIS ON KAGGLE - DO NOT RUN LOCALLY
# 1. Set up Hugging Face token in Kaggle secrets as "hf_token"
import os
from kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient
user_secrets = UserSecretsClient()
hf_token = user_secrets.get_secret("hf_token")
print(hf_token)

# 2. Login to Hugging Face
from kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient
from huggingface_hub import login

user_secrets = UserSecretsClient()
HF_TOKEN = user_secrets.get_secret("hf_token")

# Log in to Hugging Face
login(token=HF_TOKEN)
print("Successfully logged into Hugging Face!")
# 3. Clone the repository
!git clone https://github.com/jaisanth123/Intel_MediLink.git
# 4. Navigate to Python backend

%cd Intel_MediLink/backend/python

# 5. Install dependencies
!pip install uvicorn fastapi ngrok python-multipart torchvision ngrok transformers huggingface_hub pyttsx3 vaderSentiment openai-whisper

# 6. Start the server
!uvicorn app:app --port 8000
```
